# Final Project: Hospital Data Application
## Authors: Priscilla Zavala, Ikanke Inyang, Asante Anglin, Toni Benson

### Project Summary (First Iteration - CLI Program):
This program uses a command-line interface (CLI) menu to guide users through the process of retrieving hospital data. 
Users are prompted to enter their position credentials and specify a task ID to view relevant hospital information. 
The program connects to a hospital data API to retrieve and display a list of hospitals in a user-specified state. 
The user can then input a hospital ID to view detailed information for that specific hospital. The program then displays
the hospital information based on the user specified position credential and task ID.

We finishing completing the whole CLI for the second iteration, and we will add visual graphics using JavaFX and CSV export for the data to the user for the third iteration.

### Build Instructions:
In this first iteration, program is accessed via a single entry point (CLI). To build and run the program, download the code and run the main method in the Main class.
